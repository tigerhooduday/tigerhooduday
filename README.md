## 🧠 What I Actually Do

I design, implement, and deploy **production-oriented AI systems** — not notebook-only experiments.

My work sits at the intersection of:
- **LLM-powered applications**
- **Data engineering pipelines**
- **Backend systems that don’t fall apart at scale**

I care less about buzzwords and more about:
- System design
- Failure modes
- Latency, cost, and reliability
- Clear interfaces between components

## ⚙️ Core Technical Focus

### AI / Machine Learning
- Supervised & Unsupervised Learning
- Feature engineering & model evaluation
- Scikit-learn, TensorFlow
- Model explainability & validation

### LLMs & NLP
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Embeddings (Sentence-BERT)
- Vector search (FAISS)
- Prompt engineering (task, system, and failure-aware)
- Multi-LLM routing (local + hosted)

### Data Engineering
- ETL pipelines (Python, Pandas, SQL)
- REST APIs & background jobs
- Cron-based automation
- Data validation, logging, and error handling

### Backend & Infra
- FastAPI / Flask
- JWT-based authentication
- API-first system design
- Cloud deployment (GCP, Hostinger)
- Lightweight, cost-aware architecture

## 📄 Research & Engineering Mindset

- **Publication:** *Vulnerabilities and Mitigation Strategies in Facial Recognition Systems*
- I study **where AI fails**, not just where it works
- Interested in:
  - Model misuse
  - Security risks
  - Overconfidence in probabilistic systems

---

## 🧠 How I Think About Engineering

- Systems > tools
- Clarity > cleverness
- Shipping > theorizing
- Observability > blind optimism

If a system can’t be debugged, explained, or scaled — it’s not done.

## 🔍 What I’m Looking For

Roles or collaborations in:
- **AI Engineering**
- **LLM / Applied GenAI**
- **Data Engineering**

Environments where:
- Engineers own problems end-to-end
- Decisions are evidence-driven
- Learning is fast and practical
